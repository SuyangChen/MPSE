This dataset contains information about a set of families living in Florence during the Middle Ages. The setup.py file uses the data in florentine_families_relations_matrix_sample.csv to create the desired count matrices, given the desired
attributes.

The number of family connections (edges) is 448, distributed among 9 different attributes. The attributes are: ['marriage', 'business', 'partnerships', 'bankemployment', 'realestate', 'patronage', 'loan', 'friendship', 'mallevadori']. The relative frequences (in order) are: [157 58 29 14 12 44 87 17 31]. The total number of family names appearing at least once is 88. The number of times each of the families appears is [  4  13  24   3  11  20   3   1   4  15  18  38   5   2   2  10   9  14   2   6   7   4   4   5   7   5  23  10   2   5   3   2  12   4   9   3   3   3  12   7   1   8   2   5   2   8  17   9   8  10  18  28  11   1   1  15  12  14 128  10  15   7   8   3   4  35   3   1  20   4  17  10   2   5  13   5   3   5   6   1   7   9  45   7   1   6   1  13].

The python code setup.py finds the subset of families that share all specified attributes of interest and computes similarity matrices for each attribute, obtained by adding the number of times the attribrute is shared between two families. The file similarity_matrices.npy contains a (3,30,30) numpy array containing the similarity matrices for the attributes 'marriage', 'business', and 'loan', which contain the largest amount of families (30).
